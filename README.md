# Web Push Notification 

To send the notifications displayed in your React component as web push notifications to users, you'll need to integrate a server-side component that communicates with a push notification service (e.g., Firebase Cloud Messaging or OneSignal). This server-side component will handle sending the push notifications to users based on the data you want to send.

## Here's an outline of the steps to achieve this:

### Set Up a Push Notification Service:
Choose a push notification service like Firebase Cloud Messaging (FCM) or OneSignal. Follow their documentation to set up an account and configure your project.

### Server-Side Implementation:
Create a server or serverless function that will be responsible for sending push notifications. You can use Node.js, Python, or any backend technology you prefer.

### Integrate Server with React App:
In your React app, when a notification event occurs (e.g., when a user receives a new notification or approves a request), make an HTTP request to your server to trigger the push notification. Pass relevant data to the server, such as the notification title and message.

### Server-Side Logic:
On the server, implement logic to send push notifications using the chosen push notification service. For example, if you're using FCM, you'll need to send a request to the FCM API with the notification data and the target user's device token.

### Store User Device Tokens:
To send push notifications to specific users, you'll need to store their device tokens on your server when they subscribe to push notifications. When a user subscribes, save their device token along with their user ID.

### Trigger Push Notifications:
When the server receives a request from your React app to send a push notification, it should look up the device tokens associated with the target user(s) and send the notification to these tokens using the push notification service.

### Handling Unsubscribes:
Implement logic to handle cases where users unsubscribe from push notifications. When a user unsubscribes, remove their device token from your server's database.
